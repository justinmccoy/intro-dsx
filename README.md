# Overview

In this lab you will learn how to create and accunt on DSX and how to create a project.

## Prerequisites

* Bluemix supported [web browser](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/overview/prereqs.html#prereqs)

# Instructions:

To be able do this lab a Bluemix account is necessary. If you don't have one yet -- or you did not complete the initial set up of your Bluemix account -- follow the steps below.

Your account must have enough resources available for at least 1 application (128MB) and 4 services.

### Already registered and completed set-up

When you already registered and completed the initial set-up of your Bluemix account, you directly jump to [Create a space in Bluemix US region](#create-a-space-in-bluemix-us-region).

### Not registered

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the [Sign Up for Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/trial) page in a separate tab. Fill in the form and click **Start your FREE Bluemix trial** to complete the registration. You will receive an activation mail in your inbox.

### First time login

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the [Login to Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/login) in a separate tab. First time users need to complete a 4-step wizard. This starts by accepting the terms & conditions.

![Terms & conditions](images/terms.png)

Define a name for your organization.

Choose a name for your space. Typically `dev` would be a good name for your first space.

On the last page, click **I'm Ready** to complete the set up process.

### Create a space in Bluemix US region

For the remainder of this lab we switch to the **US region** of Bluemix. For this, use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent for your system) to open the Bluemix dashboard. Click your account and choose **US South** as your active region.

![Select US region](images/select-region.png)

If you are all OK, you get the dashboard. Otherwise, you will be asked to create your first space in this region -- as depicted in the screenshot below. Typically `dev` would be a good name for your space.

Congrats, you're now ready to start your data science experience :smiley:!!

# Step 1: Sign up for IBM Data Science Experience

IBM Data Science Experience is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights. In this part of the lab you will sign up for a 30-day trial of IBM Data Science Experience.

  1.  In a web browser navigate to [https://datascience.ibm.com](https://datascience.ibm.com).

  2.  Click on **Sign Up** at the top right.

  4. Follow the instructions to complete the sign up for IBM Data Science Experience. Note that two Bluemix services will be created for you -- a Cloud Object Storage service and an Apache Spark service. As soon as the 'Get Started' button is clickable, click it and you should be directed to the Data Science Experience dashboard as shown below.

2. Click on the create project icon on the top right of the project list. 

![Create Project](images/create-new-project.png)

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "Word2Vec for Text Data". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a defualt name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.

 > You are now in your new project where you can create notebooks and data assets as well as add collaborators.
